Google's Get Ahead Program Technical Challenge Week 1 - 4th June 2018


This Week’s Technical Challenge 

Each week we’ll provide you with past practice problems and will release all solutions at the end of the program so you can work at your own pace.


Given a list of iterators, implement a FlattenedIterator class which incrementally iterates over the integers from all the iterators in an interleaved fashion. 

 

An iterator implements the next() and hasNext() interface. You're free to use them, and you will implement them on the FlattenedIterator class.

 

Things to clarify:

- You're free to initialize FlattenedIterator with any data structure of your choice for the iterators.

 

Test Cases

For iterator set [1,2,3], [4,5] and [6,7,8], the FlattenedIterator should yield an iterator over [1,4,6,2,5,7,3,8].

Iterators [1,2,3], [] and [6,7], yield iterator [1,6,2,7,3].
