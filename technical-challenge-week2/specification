This Week’s Technical Challenge 

Each week we’ll provide you with past interview problems to develop your technical skills. Go at your own pace. To ensure you’re getting the most out of the Get Ahead program, we encourage you to complete all of the problems.

During interviews we evaluate candidates on their ability to step through their code with examples/tests in order to verify their solution and fix bugs. We have provided you with a few examples/tests to start with.

Given a string of parentheses, find the size of the longest continuous substring of balanced parenthesis. Parentheses are considered balanced when there is a valid closing parenthesis for an opening one.

Test Cases

Note that there may be other valid answers.

For parentheses "( ) ) ( ( ) )", the longest continuous set would be 4 characters long (the last 4 characters of the input)

For ") ( ( ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( )" , the max length would be 4
